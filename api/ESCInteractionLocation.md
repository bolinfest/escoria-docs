# ESCInteractionLocation

**Extends:** [ESCLocation](../ESCLocation) < [Position2D](../Position2D)

## Description

Â A simple node extending Position2D with a global ID so that it can be
referenced in ESC Scripts. Movement-based commands like `walk_to_pos` will
automatically use an `ESCLocation` that is a child of the destination node.
Commands like `turn_to`--which are not movement-based--will ignore child
`ESCLocation`s and refer to the parent node.
