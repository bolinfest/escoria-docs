# ESCEvent

**Extends:** [ESCStatement](../ESCStatement) < [Reference](../Reference)

## Description

An event in the ESC language

Events are triggered from various sources. Common events include

* :setup : This event is always the first to be called each time the room is visited.
   It allows elements in the room to be prepared *before* the room is displayed to the
   player (e.g. starting particle effects).
* :ready : This event is the second to be called each time the room is visited.
   It is run immediately after `:setup` finishes execution, if it exists. Otherwise,
   `:ready` will be the first event to run. Regardless, this event is run *after*
   the room is displayed to the player, allowing cutscenes or animations to be
   run once the room is visible.
* :use <global id> Called from the current item when it is used with the item
  with the global id <global id>
